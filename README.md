## About
I first started Leetcode in Java ‚òïÔ∏è, as it was my first programming language, I'm now focused on learning Rust so my new solutions are written in that language ü¶Ä,

> [!note]
> some of the solutions i write, primary for Grind75 problems are in python üêç because of FAANG OA that don't support Rust

This repository aims to help me **find previously implemented algorithms**, as well as to **track my progression**

## Goals
- [ ] Leetcode tshirt
- [ ] Properly learning Dynamic programming
- [ ] Properly learning Back tracking
- [ ] Being not horrible in contests
- [ ] Finish [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/)

## Challenge
Starting from the 2 of August 2024, I will try to solve daily problems for one year straight.
- 16/02/2025 : 200 Days!
